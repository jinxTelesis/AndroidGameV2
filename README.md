Android Game Version 2 consists of 12 stages where the player drags the correct icons and drops them over the movement squares.
If the player is correct the sprite will move across the stage and the level will be complete. After every 3 levels a score is show
and the player is prompted to continue. There is also a adult login that allows you to see all the child scores using an Anychart API
graph.
